## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. The following packages are recommended:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tensorflow or pytorch (depending on the implementation)

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

If the repository includes Jupyter notebooks, you can start Jupyter Notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Alternatively, run the Python scripts directly from the command line:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you wish to execute.

## Repository Structure

Below is a suggested structure for the repository. Feel free to adjust this structure to match your project's organization:
